Place any .ogg or .mp3 files you want into this folder for it to be randomly selected as a World Record notification sound.
Alternatively only put one sound file in here if you want it to be the same every time.


NOTE: When one of these sounds play IT WILL NOT STOP PLAYING. 
I would recommend not adding anything longer than 3-5 seconds unless you are ok with sitting through it's entirety or 
have it overlap with whatever songs you are scrolling over in the song wheel lol.
