----------Other----------

- Song search: Returns song(s) based on what the player searched for. (defaults to alphabetical if no subsort)

- Mark as Favorite: Have an option in the sort menu to mark the current song (or group?) 
to add to your "favorites". Saves them to a file in the player's profile like "DD-Favorites.txt"

- Test Input Screen: This already exists, just need to add it in.

- Switch from SINGLE/DOUBLE. [Seperately saved sorts for single vs double? or same?]


----------SORT----------

- Group: Normal groups in alphabetical order. (if no subsorts/filters)

- Title: Songs sorted alphabetically with a seperate folder for each letter + numbers/symbols

- Artist - Sorts songs into individual folders (alphabetically) for each artist.

- Length - Sorts songs by length to the full second.
Folder structure based on(?):
5sec increments for songs <3min
10sec increments for songs >=3min and <5min
30sec increments for songs >=5min and <10min
5min increments for songs >=10min and <30min
10min increments for songs <=30min and <1h
all 1h+ songs in one folder

- NPS: Sorts songs in order of their max NPS, 
but with folder structure based on their 16th stream BPM equivalents. 
(Songs that have charts with different max NPS will show up again across multiple folders with the corresponding difficulty highlighted.)

- Difficulty: Sorts all charts by difficulty in a folder for each one. 
Songs with multiple charts will appear across multiple folders and the correct chart will be highlighted
based on what folder you are in.
(If this is possible) In the event that there are multiple charts with the same difficulty 
have it select the one that you are closest to in the song wheel if you aren't already on it.
Otherwise just having multiple instances of it in the same folder is ok with it highlighting for each one.

----------SUBSORT----------

- idk how this is going to work tbh. Like only 1 sub sort or another layer or more?

defaults?
Group: default subsort is by title obviously
Title: default subsort is by group? so i guess as is lol
Artist: default subsort is title
Length: default subsort is title? (maybe difficulty)
NPS: default subsort is difficulty, note count, then title?
Difficulty: default subsort it note count?


----------FILTER----------

Filters can be stacked. If no songs are available based on user settings let them know they fucked up and/or undo their most recent filter that fucked it up.

- NPS: Only shows songs within a certain BPM range (based on MaxNPS)

- Favorites: Only shows the songs/groups you selected as your favorite.
